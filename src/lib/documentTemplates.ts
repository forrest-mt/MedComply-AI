## 1. Purpose

The Quality Manual describes the Quality Management System (QMS), its documented procedures or reference to them, and a description of the interaction between the processes of the QMS. The quality manual is used to communicate the company's quality policy and objectives to the organization and to provide an overview of the quality management system.

## 2. Scope

The QMS described in this Quality Manual applies to all products of the manufacturer and applies a risk based approach to the control of the appropriate processes needed for the quality management system.

## 3. Applicable Standards

The following standards are considered applicable to the QMS:

* ISO 13485:2016 Medical devices - Quality management systems - Requirements for regulatory purposes
* ISO 14971:2019 Medical devices - Application of risk management to medical devices
* IEC 62366-1:2015 Medical devices - Part 1: Application of usability engineering to medical devices
* IEC 62304:2006 Medical device software - Software life cycle processes
* 21 CFR 820 - QMSR

## 4. QMS Exclusions
